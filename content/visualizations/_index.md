This interactive map shows different priority areas for marine conservation within Brazil's Exclusive Economic Zone. It includes multiple layers such as wetlands, coral reefs, marine protected areas (MPAs), and others. These layers can be toggled on and off. A detailed metadata table with descriptions of each layer and its data source is available below the map.
