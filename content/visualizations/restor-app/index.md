**Details:** <br>
RestoR is a data-driven tool developed by the Galapagos Verde 2050 team to streamline restoration planning and monitoring across the Galapagos Islands. It supports decision-making for over 100 sites and 20,000+ plants, helping the team focus more time on ecosystem restoration and less on repetitive data analysis tasks.
