**Details:** <br>
This interactive tool was developed as part of my [master's group project](https://maricultura.weebly.com/) at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. It allows users to identify suitable mariculture areas within Brazil's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), assess biomass production potential, and evaluate site-level profitability.
