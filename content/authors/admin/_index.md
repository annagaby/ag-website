Hi everyone! My name is Anna. I am a Research Assistant for the [Galapagos Verde 2050 Project](http://www.galapagosverde2050.com/). I work restoring degraded ecosystems in 7 different islands of the Galapagos. I spend most of my time studying endangered plant species, collecting field data, and conducting germination experiments.
