Hi everyone! My name is Anna. I'm a Research Assistant for the Galápagos Verde 2050 Project. I get to work restoring degraded ecosystems in 7 different islands of the Galapagos. I spend most of my time studying/taking care of endangered plant species, writing R code, and going on planting/monitoring expeditions.
